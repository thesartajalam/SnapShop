# 🛍️ SnapShop - Location-Based Shop Access App

SnapShop is a **React Native (Expo)** app that utilizes **mock login** and **real-time location detection** to allow users to access specific shops within a **300-meter proximity**. Whether you're testing geofencing, location-triggered access, or simply building a smart local discovery app — SnapShop offers a clean and modern foundation to work from.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

👉 **Mock Authentication** – Simple login screen to simulate user authentication.  
👉 **Location Permission Handling** – Requests and handles foreground location permissions with user alerts.  
👉 **Shop Detection Based on Proximity** – Detects if a user is within 300 meters of any predefined shops.  
👉 **Dynamic Navigation** – Automatically navigates users to **Shop Screen** if near a shop, else takes them to **Home Screen**.  
👉 **Reusable UI Components** – Custom-built buttons, loading overlays, logout, and headers.  
👉 **Structured Codebase** – Separation of screens, UI components, utility functions, and constants for clean maintainability.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React Native (Expo)** – Framework for cross-platform mobile development.
- **Expo Location API** – To get user's current geolocation.
- **AsyncStorage** – For temporary token storage simulating login state.
- **React Native Navigation** – Navigation stack using Native Stack.
- **Custom Hooks & Utility Functions** – For cleaner logic separation.

## 🔐 Authentication Details (Mock)

* No actual backend authentication
* The token is saved in **AsyncStorage**
* Logging out clears the storage and navigates to `LoginScreen`

---

## 💡 How Proximity Works

* User's current location is compared to predefined shop coordinates using the **Haversine formula**.
* If distance ≤ 300 meters ➡️ navigates to `ShopScreen`.
* Else ➡️ shows `HomeScreen`.

## ✨ Final Thoughts

SnapShop is built to simulate a **real-world location-aware app**. It's simple, lightweight, and modular — ideal for learning or for building something even bigger on top of it!
